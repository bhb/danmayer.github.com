## Topic / Post Ideas

* DCI is sort of interesting but seems to go against LOC==bugs and Kingdom of Nouns post which really makes me upset to see DCI with .excute methods seems close to what I like and envision but actually to heavy weight
  * http://vimeo.com/8235574     
* Improve JS runner to handle multiple examples, and do a post about that as a plugin and show some usage examples
* post about JS titles I saw and incorporated along with having JS runner allow users to activate some of the example code.
* Graphite unused view layout / partial tracking
* Smokescreen and the importance of fast test / fast feedback loop, and that sometimes if the tests are really slow they actually have a negative value even if they do test some edge case
* Writing code vs. app builders / generators, and how I am disappointed to still be building applications with dense text in a 20+ year old editorâ€¦ There has been progress, but with progress some people should be able to create programs knowing far less of the underlying details. (How yeoman, meteor, the JS world, and closure are making tiny but at least better progress on on modern flows)
* Automate everything, all the way down (chef/ec2, dot files / emacs, Boxen looks cool because of this, etc)
