## Advice from my Grandfather, "Show up"

My grandfather had some advice for me about being good at your job. He shared this with me at some point in life. I am not sure when exactly he passed it on to me, it might have been before college or when I visited after college right before my first job. It has always suck with me, and I think of it often as I approach challenges or teaching. I don't remember the exact quotable, but more the spirit of the thought.

#### "90% of being good at something is just to keep showing up"

Faced with something hard, keep showing up and work at it. Sometimes take on the hard challenge no one else is taking on. Push your self, take on challenges just out of your own grasp.

I think in the end this is a bit related to the common advice that it takes [10,000 hours to become a expert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29). Want to get to 10,000 hours? Keep showing up and working at your craft, it can [take over 10 years](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sportingscene/2013/08/psychology-ten-thousand-hour-rule-complexity.html) to become an expert.

### Reminding me of the advice motivates me

* is there a really important project that no one seems to find 'cool' enough to work on, show up
* unexpected issues days before a release, dig in solve it, solve it for the release.
* finished with the 90% interesting part of the project but that last mile needs to get done. Show up up for the team to help pull it through to the end.

Showing up, is important for a variety of reasons. The actions you take shape the way people view you. Being willing to pitch in, everyone on your team will appreciate your efforts and know your willing to help get whatever job done. Your manager and your company will appreciate you for it. Want to be a leader or become one of the best on the team? Showing up is a great way to always learn. You might not start as the best, but if you are one of the people the consistently shows up and steps in when needed, you will become one. How do you become skilled in all areas of a career, by taking on tasks and challenges when they need to be done even if you don't know the solution. You can see knowledge spread to people who work this way, some of the junior developers on multiple occasions have stuck around to watch over the shoulders of more experience devs while they dug into and solved an emergency. Sure enough next time similar issues came up, the junior develops who had watched before stepped in and jumped on the tasks themselves while a senior dev checked in to see that it was going well. It can be amazing how much knowledge gets shared this way.

If you like to learn new things this is always a great thing to do as well. Who wants to just get really good at solving the same problem over and over? Unknown mystery exceptions occurring a handful of times. Add monitoring, metrics, read up on the related systems, put in probes to verify your understand. Track it down and suddenly you know more about a subsystem than anyone else around. 

The number of things I have learned this way has been to many to count, it is something I have always like about being a developer, there is no real way to peg me to a specific job. As software eats the world, I am learning the skills and tools to quickly make myself productive in nearly any area of a business. System Security, Business Analytics, Performance,  Debugging, Real Time dashboards, big data, personalization, mobile, infrastructure... All things I have mostly learned on the job

So if you want to learn a ton, be one of the best on your team, become unreplacable at your company, expand your skill set, and become excellent at your job. Keep showing up, especially when no one else can at the moment.

(note this doesn't mean you need to work all the time or that you should always be doing the work no one else would be willing to, but it does mean taking on any responsibility and not ignore important work and parts of the process just because that isn't 'developer' work or strictly writing code)
