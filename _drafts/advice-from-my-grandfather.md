## Show up

My grandfather had some advice for me at some point in life. I am not sure when exactly he passed it on to me, it might have been before college or when I visited after college right before my first job. Regardless of when he shared this little piece of advice, it has always suck with me, and seems more true the older I get. I don't remember the exact words, but more the spirit of the thought.

"90% of being good at something is just to keep showing up"

Faced with something hard, keep showing up and work at it.

10,000 hours to become a expert, keep showing up and working at it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29 over 10 years http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sportingscene/2013/08/psychology-ten-thousand-hour-rule-complexity.html

is there a really important project that no one seems to find 'cool' enough to work on, show up

unexpected issues days before a release, dig in solve it, solve it for the release

This is important for a variety of reasons. The actions you take shape the way people view you. By always being willing to pitch in, everyone on your team will appreciate you. Your manager and your company will appreciate you for it. You want to be a leader or become one of the best on the team? You might not start as the best, but if you are one of the people the consistently shows up and steps in when needed, you will become one. How does one really become skilled in all areas of a career, but taking on tasks and challenges when they need to be done even if you don't know how to do them. Where I work there are a number of developers that work this way, some of the junior developers have even stuck around to just watch over the shoulder while other devs dug into and solved an emergency. Sure enough next time something like that came up, the junior devs who had watched before stepped in and jumped on the tasks themselves while a senior dev checked in to see that it was going well. It can be amazing to see how much people can learn this way.

If you like to learn new things this is always a great thing to do as well. Who wants to just get really good at solving the same problem over and over? Unknown mystery exceptions occurring a handful of times. Add monitoring, metrics, read up on the related systems, put in probes to verify your understand. Track it down and suddenly you know more about a subsystem than anyone else around. 

The number of things I have learned this way has been to many to count, it is something I have always like about being a developer, there is no real way to peg me to a specific job. As software eats the world, I am learning the skills and tools to quickly make myself productive in nearly any area of a business. System Security, Business Analytics, Performance,  Debugging, Real Time dashboards, big data, personalization, mobile, infrastructure... All things I have mostly learned on the job

So if you want to learn a ton, be one of the best on your team, become unreplacable at your company, expand your skill set, and become excellent at your job. Keep showing up, especially when no one else can at the moment.

(note this doesn't mean you need to work all the time or that you should always be doing the work no one else would be willing to, but it does mean taking on any responsibility and not ignore important work and parts of the process just because that isn't 'developer' work or strictly writing code)
