I don't think there are many posts talking about how to get into presenting at programming conferences. I doubt I am even particularly good at it, but I still felt I might ahve some information to share. If you are interested in speaking at programming conferences and think you have some interesting information to share, hopefully this post can help you on your path.


If you have any feedback on the proposal below you can use [draftin to submit your changes to my document](http://bit.ly/1hWVh9f).

## The git log of my RubyNation talk

1. I wrote a post about [Coverband code coverage](https://techblog.livingsocial.com/blog/2013/12/17/coverband-production-ruby-code-coverage/) on the [Livingsocial techblog](https://techblog.livingsocial.com)
2. I gave a 5 min. lightning talk at [MountainWest RubyConf](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/). ([slides: coverband lightning talk](http://www.mayerdan.com/coverband-lightning/))
3. I decided I wanted to expand on this subject and started seeking some help putting together my first talk proposal. Asking co-workers and online friends for help [improving my proposal](http://www.mayerdan.com/programming/2014/03/25/production-code-analysis-talk-proposal/). I got lots of great feedback.
4. I submitted my proposal to a couple conferences I was interested in speaking at.
    * [GoRuCo Conf](http://goruco.com/), not accepted
    * [RubyNation](http://www.rubynation.org/), accepted
5. I expanded the talk to give a longer (10 min.) lightning talk at Railsconf, as part of the [Living Social Lightning Talks (video)](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3400-railsconf-living-social-lightning-talks) sessions. ([slides: coverband Railsconf talk](http://www.mayerdan.com/coverband-railsconf/))
6. I expanded the talk out and gave the presentation internally as part of our livingsocial speaker series to our developers. Asking for feedback from our team which helped me to improve the slides and talk.
7. I worked feedback into my presentation and gave dry runs hooked up to a projector to myself a number of times to get comfortable with my slides and talk.
8. I gave my presentation at [RubyNation](http://www.rubynation.org/) and tried to remember what [Russ Olsen](http://russolsen.com/) told me, "everyone watching really wants to see you succeed." I am sure I learned a lot in the process even if it didn't go quite as well as I hoped.
    * final slides: [Production Code Analysis: Tales of deleting 200K+ LOC](http://www.mayerdan.com/rubynation-production-code-analysis/)
    * video of my talk (link not yet available, should be soon)
 
## Developing an Idea

I recommend starting small with an idea. Giving smaller lighting talks or short talks at local Ruby meetups to judge if there is enough material to go deeper and enough interest to justify more effort. Watch some presentations and see what kind of style you think matches yourself, same for looking at various talks slides. Write a short blog post, or even a outline for yourself to see if you have more material.

Seek out people to help give you feedback, in all stages of the process. On the initial idea, while working on the proposal, and as you develop it into a full talk.


## Problems I had

* projects, stay off the edges of slides projectors could be set up poorly or blur on edges
* bring water
* try to present on your own laptop
* white and grey backgrounds work better than very dark or black backgrounds on projects that don't have great contrast
* speak more from your memorization and thoughts evoked from your slides opposed to reading (I did very bad on this)
* any live demos practice through on the 2 screen setup a few times
* get good at setting up two monitors my screens swapped sides dominate screens right before my talk
* smaller code snippets
* animated gives while a easy way to get a laught still are appreciated by the audience and keep people engaged, go for it.
* talks work better for bigger ideas and thoughts not for the nitty gritty of code and specifics save that for a blog posts ;)
* get good with whatever slide presentation software you end up using. I used [deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js) which is pretty cool, but still not as powerfull as things like keynote.
* nervousness, while I learned a lot. I think I learned public speaking isn't really my thing. I am far more comfortable writing a post or working out ideas ahead of time. I might continue to work on this, but in the end I doubt it is my best format for sharing ideas.
