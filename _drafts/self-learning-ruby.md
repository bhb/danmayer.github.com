I think everyone in today's world should be learning a little about how to code. If you use a computer at some point you will want to better understand how it works, or you will want to be able to create something on it opposed to only consume. Even learning some of the basics of programming will help you understand how the applications you use to socialize or get work done function. If you can learn the basics of how to create a webpage, apply styles, and add interactivity and storing data it will come in useful far more often than one can imagine even if you never become a "developer".

Since early in the days of the internet you could basically find everything you needed to learn about programming online. In the last few years there has been a explosion of online education. Not just for programming but for learning nearly anything one would want to study. I have been really interested in online and self learning education in general. As various people have asked about programming or wanting help making basic web pages I have been specifically looking at developer education online. It is amazing how quickly the space is growing and how great the resources have become for anyone who is really interested in learning just a bit to make their own web pages, to those that want to learn it all and make a career out of software development.

### Self Guided Free (where to start)

Before going to a school or even a online class that has a pace and assignments I recommend starting with self learning at your own pace. Spend some time on nights and weekends and learn some of the basics and see what parts of programming might interest you.
  
I really recommend everyone starts by learning the basics of web programming. The beginner friendly courses at [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) is where I recommend everyone starts

1. [HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
2. [Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
3. Finally a "backend" language like [Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) or [Python](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)

After that learning more and getting a deeper understand of a programming language of computer science basics in general makes sense.
