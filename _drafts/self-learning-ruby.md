I think everyone in today's world should be learning a little about how to code. If you use a computer at some point you will want to better understand how it works, or you will want to be able to create something on it opposed to only consume. Even learning some of the basics of programming will help you understand how the applications you use to socialize or work function. If you can learn the basics of how to create a webpage, apply styles, and add interactivity/data storage you will know all the basics. It will come in useful far more often than one can imagine even if you never become a "developer".

Since early in the days of the internet you could basically find everything you needed to learn about programming online. In the last few years there has been a explosion of online education. Not just for programming but for learning nearly anything one would want to study. I have been really interested in online and self learning education in general. As various people have asked about programming or wanting help making basic web pages I have been specifically looking at developer education online. It is amazing how quickly the space is growing and how great the resources have become for anyone who is really interested in learning just a bit to make their own web pages, to those that want to learn it all and make a career out of software development. As the education approaches the career level there is offline components but even those programming bootcamps are a new and interesting education model.

__Note since I program primarly in Ruby, the resources are slightly skewed towards Ruby. Many offer multiple languages and there are additional programs focused on other languages that might interest you.__

### Self Guided Free (where to start)

Before going to a school or even a online class that has a pace and assignments I recommend starting with self learning at your own pace. Spend some time on nights and weekends and learn some of the basics and see what parts of programming might interest you.
  
I really recommend everyone starts by learning the basics of web programming. The beginner friendly courses at [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) is where I recommend everyone starts

1. [HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
2. [Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
3. Finally a "backend" language like [Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) or [Python](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)

After that learning more and getting a deeper understand of a programming language of computer science basics in general makes sense.

### No Silver Bullet

I think all of this is really promising and interesting, but the industry is young. Mistakes will be made, some will be poorly trained, some flat out ripped off while seeking knowledge. Make sure to research your choices, and just like college you really will get out of it what you put into it. As the [LeVar Burton says on Reading Rainbow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Rainbow) "But you don't have to take my word for it"
