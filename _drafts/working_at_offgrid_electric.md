# Investing Your Time

This post is what initially got me thinking about [working at Offgrid Electric](https://medium.com/electric-africa/a-dream-job-for-someone-who-loves-adventure-d256b8d21a97)

I joined this team, as I have a passion for international teams working on impactful issues. The team is truly global, while deploying solar as a service to East Africa. I lead a team to deliver a reliable software platform allowing us to expand across markets with unique payment, delivery, and logistics challenges.

"Across sub-Saharan Africa, fully 590 million people lack access to power. And it's a life-or-death issue: Indoor air pollution from wood stoves now kills 3.5 million people per year, more than AIDS and malaria combined." --[Brad Plumer](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/02/a-closer-look-at-obamas-7-billion-plan-to-bring-electricity-to-africa/)
