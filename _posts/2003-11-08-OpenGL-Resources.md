This is a collection of various tips and things I use or have done in OpenGL. This is actually up on the web more as a refrence to myself than anything else. This is a collection of good links, programs, tutorials, and source code. That I have found usefull, created, or thought would be usefull to others. So enjoy any and all of my OpenGL info.

3D shooter I wrote, it could obviously be improved alot but it is a good easy start.<BR>

You can download the source and the exe and everything and mess with it yourself. This was written in Visual Studio.net   <a href="http://www.deadawakemovie.com/ml/files/Mayer_GL.zip">Get it</a>

I also made a fractal program into a openGL winamp plug in.  If your interested in doing conversions to a winamp plug in yourself, you can download the source and the DLL for winamp and mess around with this.<BR>
