<a href="http://avdi.org/devblog">Avdi</a> a ex-Devver, developer, has just announced that <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2010/06/11/open-for-business/">ShipRise LLC</a> is open for business. He is looking to do freelancing/contracting for Ruby and other hard development problems.  I can attest to Avdi's skill in breaking down hard problems (like distributed test running) into elegant simple solutions. If you are looking for a great dev to work with you on a project, ping him.

Besides Ruby and general coding, Avdi is ready to help with "Dispersed team facilitation", which he has long term experience with. If you have a small distributed team of developers, he can help get everyone on the right path to work together, while being apart. He is gather a ton of information to help remote workers at his new blog <a href="http://wideteams.com/">Wide Teams</a>.
