My nephew is interested in robots. I told him that we could build a robot together and he got really excited. Originally my plan was to get Lego mindstorms, but considering it is $350. I am hoping to find a cheaper way to test out the waters. Also, at his current age I assume he will want to keep what we build and may be a bit rough with it. I figure when he is a bit older Lego mindstorms is the way to go.

## Anyone know of simple and fun robot kits?

* Nephew just turned 6
* Looking for something we can put together
* Simple action like pushing a button to cause the robot to drive forward for X seconds
* Looking to build something my newphew could keep and play with.

If anyone has any ideas shoot me an email, comment, or tweet.
