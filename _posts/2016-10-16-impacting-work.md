### Don't take my word for it

> "Across sub-Saharan Africa, fully 590 million people lack access to power. And it's a life-or-death issue: Indoor air pollution from wood stoves now kills 3.5 million people per year, more than AIDS and malaria combined." --[Brad Plumer: Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/02/a-closer-look-at-obamas-7-billion-plan-to-bring-electricity-to-africa/)

Over the years, I have learned to respect [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/) for his passionate endeavors to change the world. His recent post highlighted the importance of the work we do at Offgrid. We deliver directly on #1 and provide free power to schools helping enable #4.

> There are four objectives I think we should prioritize:
> 
> 1. Provide everyone on earth with affordable energy without contributing to climate change.
> 2. Develop a vaccine for HIV and a cure for neurodegenerative diseases.
> 3. Protect the world from future health epidemics, which might be more infectious than Ebola and more deadly than Zika.
> 4. Give every student and teacher new tools so all students get a world-class education.

Another, current inescapable name in the technology world these days is Elon Musk, who is know for his passion for Solar energy.

> “this handy fusion reactor in the sky, where you don’t have to do anything—it works, it shows up every day, and it produces ridiculous amounts of power.” --[the deal with Solar](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/the-deal-with-solar.html)

> "This is because the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution."  --[Original Tesla Master Plan](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) (recently doubled down in [Master Plan, Part Duex](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux)

Musk clearly believes in it because he is an investor in Offgrid Electric, through his involvement with [SolarCity](http://www.solarcity.com/). He recently talked of the kind of impact we are working to deliver.

> "This allows you to go completely off grid. It’s analogous to the way that mobile leapfrogged landlines." --[Tesla Energy Will Help World’s Poor Leapfrog the Grid](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-01/musk-says-tesla-energy-will-help-world-s-poor-leapfrog-the-grid)
