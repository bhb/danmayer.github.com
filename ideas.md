title: "Random Ideas"

{% include JB/setup %}

I just wanted a place I can list ideas as I have them and then post links to either the project when I build it. Or far more likely the link to a existing project when I find someone already implemented it, or possibly a blog post about why I decided it was a bad idea after I looked into it a bit more. Most of these aren't really fully thought out but a sentence or two I jot down to refresh my memory when I ponder some thought.

# Project Ideas


* Sinatra app that just polls mysql slow and displays it with history etc
* github -> kindle reader format the code for kindle readability and have links / section browsing for the files.
* remote ping pong pair programming over a shared updated git repo or gist.
* churn as a tiny app / service run on deferred-servers
* combiner allows multiple micro apps / apis to be combined by connecting them feeding one into another JSON can be uploaded or output nice html wysiwyg interface, has a container app for app running.
* google map game... point on a map, red virus starts to spread... survive as long as possible, traveling and trying to be in the last city overtaken by the virus... Like the opposite of pandemic 2
* community chess play as a team. (you make random moves in games with a collective group of people, your score is the aggregate of how many games you win. You never end up making a move in a game against yourself, but you can be in N/2 total games at any time.)
* build something liked his but perhaps for stocks or ruby community? http://disqus.com/gravity/

# Solved past Ideas

* Better local development environment configuration: 
  * One problem with database.yml if the development configuration file is checked it, it really can't be used for local environment configuration, allow for local overrides. All systems will not be setup the same
  * How to allow better overrides for multiple systems different dev configurations possibly different server deployments?
  * Looks like best solution is [figaro rails configuration](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro)
* tiny micro services from people, this is pretty cool [fiverr](http://fiverr.com/)
